# File Organizer Using Python 

This is a simple Python script for organizing files in a directory. It helps you keep your files organized by categorizing them into specific folders based on their file extensions.

## How it Works

The script scans a specified directory for files and then moves them into subdirectories based on their file extensions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or copy the code of `organiser.py` file.

2. Open the `organizer.py` file in a text editor or IDE.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `organizer.py` script.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python organizer.py
   ```

5. Specify the directory to be organised, the script then move files to their respective folders based on their extensions.
